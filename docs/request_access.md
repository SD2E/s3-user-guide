Access to S3 Data Uploads is restricted to TA3 data providers. If you are an
SD2E project member, you can upload, download, and manage data and files via
the web service APIs and portal application. Data that is uploaded by TA3
performers will be made accessible in the broader SD2E infrastructure after
it has passed automated validation. 

TA3 performers may request access to S3 Data Uploads by send an email to
support@sd2e.org. Please include **S3 Data Access** in the email title.
