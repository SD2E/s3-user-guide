## Program Resources

SD2 program users can upload to the following buckets:

* `reference`
* `testing`
* `uploads`

SD2 Partner Programs upload to their respective buckets:

* SafeGenes - `data-projects-safegenes`
* ECHO - `data-projects-safegenes`

Files uploaded to these bcukets are automatically picked up by indexing and
other automated processes and usually become available for general use within a
few minutes.
